<p>Many kinds of memory safety vulnerabilities have been endangering software systems for decades. Amongst other
approaches, fuzzing is a promising technique to unveil various software faults. Recently, feedback-guided fuzzing
demonstrated its power, producing a steady stream of security-critical software bugs. Most fuzzing efforts—especially
feedback fuzzing—are limited to user space components of an operating system (OS), although bugs in kernel components
are more severe, because they allow an attacker to gain access to a system with full privileges. Unfortunately, kernel
components are difficult to fuzz as feedback mechanisms (i.e., guided code coverage) cannot be easily applied.
Additionally, non-determinism due to interrupts, kernel threads, statefulness, and similar mechanisms poses problems.
Furthermore, if a process fuzzes its own kernel, a kernel crash highly impacts the performance of the fuzzer as the OS
needs to reboot.</p>
<p>In this paper, we approach the problem of coverage-guided kernel fuzzing in an OS-independent and hardware-assisted way:
We utilize a hypervisor and Intel’s Processor Trace (PT) technology. This allows us to remain independent of the target
OS as we just require a small user space component that interacts with the targeted OS. As a result, our approach
introduces almost no performance overhead, even in cases where the OS crashes, and performs up to 17,000 executions per
second on an off-the-shelf laptop. We developed a framework called kernel-AFL (kAFL) to assess the security of Linux,
macOS, and Windows kernel components. Among many crashes, we uncovered several flaws in the ext4 driver for Linux, the
HFS and APFS file system of macOS, and the NTFS driver of Windows.</p>

<p>Automated software testing based on fuzzing has experienced a revival in recent years. Especially feedback-driven
fuzzing has become well-known for its ability to efficiently perform randomized testing with limited input corpora.
Despite a lot of progress, two common problems are magic numbers and (nested) checksums. Computationally expensive
methods such as taint tracking and symbolic execution are typically used to overcome such roadblocks. Unfortunately,
such methods often require access to source code, a rather precise description of the environment (e.g., behavior of
library calls or the underlying OS), or the exact semantics of the platform&rsquo;s instruction set.</p>
<p>In this paper, we introduce a lightweight, yet very effective alternative to taint tracking and symbolic execution to
facilitate and optimize state-of-the-art feedback fuzzing that easily scales to large binary applications and unknown
environments.  We observe that during the execution of a given program, parts of the input often end up directly (i.e.,
nearly unmodified) in the program state. This input-to-state correspondence can be exploited to create a robust method
to overcome common fuzzing roadblocks in a highly effective and efficient manner.  Our prototype implementation, called
REDQUEEN, is able to solve magic bytes and (nested) checksum tests automatically for a given binary executable.
Additionally, we show that our techniques outperform various state-of-the-art tools on a wide variety of targets across
different privilege levels (kernel-space and userland) with no platform-specific code.  REDQUEEN is the first method to
find more than 100% of the bugs planted in LAVA-M across all targets. Furthermore, we were able to discover 65 new bugs
and obtained 16 CVEs in multiple programs and OS kernel drivers. Finally, our evaluation demonstrates that REDQUEEN is
fast, widely applicable and outperforms concurrent approaches by up to three orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Fuzzing is a well-known method for efficiently identifying bugs in programs.  Unfortunately, when fuzzing targets that
require highly-structured inputs such as interpreters, many fuzzing methods struggle to pass the syntax checks.  More
specifically, interpreters often process inputs in multiple stages: first syntactic, then semantic correctness is
checked. Only if these checks are passed, the interpreted code gets executed.  This prevents fuzzers from executing
&ldquo;deeper&rdquo; - and hence potentially more interesting - code.  Typically two valid inputs that lead to the execution of
different features in the target application require too many mutations for simple mutation-based fuzzers to discover:
making small changes like bit flips usually only leads to the execution of error paths in the parsing engine.  So-called
grammar fuzzers are able to pass the syntax checks by using Context-Free Grammars.  Using feedback can significantly
increase the efficiency of fuzzing engines.  Hence, it is commonly used in state-of-the-art mutational fuzzers that do
not use grammars.  Yet, grammar fuzzers do not make use of code coverage, i.e., they do not know whether any input
triggers new functionality or not.</p>
<p>In this paper, we propose NAUTILUS, a method to efficiently fuzz programs that require highly-structured inputs by
combining the use of grammars with the use of code coverage feedback.  This allows us to recombine aspects of
interesting inputs that were learned individually, and to dramatically increase the probability that any generated input
will be accepted by the parser.  We implemented a proof-of-concept fuzzer that we tested on multiple targets, including
ChakraCore (the JavaScript engine of Microsoft Edge), PHP, mruby, and Lua.  NAUTILUS identified multiple bugs in all of
the targets: Seven in mruby, three in PHP, two in ChakraCore, and one in Lua.  Reporting these bugs was awarded with a
sum of 2600 USD and 6 CVEs were assigned.  Our experiments show that combining context-free grammars and feedback-driven
fuzzing significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches like American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) by an order of magnitude and
grammar fuzzers by more than a factor of two when measuring code coverage.</p>

<p>In the past few years, fuzzing has received significant attention from the research community. However, most of this
attention was directed towards programs without a dedicated parsing stage. In such cases, fuzzers which leverage the
input structure of a program can achieve a significantly higher code coverage compared to traditional fuzzing
approaches. This advancement in coverage is achieved by applying large-scale mutations in the application&rsquo;s input space.
However, this improvement comes at the cost of requiring expert domain knowledge, as these fuzzers depend on structure
input specifications (e.g., grammars). Grammar inference, a technique which can automatically generate such grammars for
a given program, can be used to address this shortcoming. Such techniques usually infer a program&rsquo;s grammar in a
pre-processing step and can miss important structures that are uncovered only later during normal fuzzing.</p>
<p>In this paper, we present the design and implementation of GRIMOIRE, a fully automated coverage-guided fuzzer which
works without any form of human interaction or pre-configuration; yet, it is still able to efficiently test programs
that expect highly structured inputs. We achieve this by performing large-scale mutations in the program input space
using grammar-like combinations to synthesize new highly structured inputs without any pre-processing step. Our
evaluation shows that GRIMOIRE outperforms other coverage-guided fuzzers when fuzzing programs with highly structured
inputs. Furthermore, it improves upon existing grammar-based coverage-guided fuzzers. Using GRIMOIRE, we identified 19
distinct memory corruption bugs in real-world programs and obtained 11 new CVEs.</p>

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
<p>Although current fuzz testing (fuzzing) methods are
highly effective, there are still many situations such as complex
state machines where fully automated approaches fail. State-of-
the-art fuzzing methods offer very limited ability for a human
to interact and aid the fuzzer in such cases. More specifically,
most current approaches are limited to adding a dictionary or
new seed inputs to guide the fuzzer. When dealing with complex
programs, these mechanisms are unable to uncover new parts of
the code base.
In this paper, we propose IJON, an annotation mechanism
that a human analyst can use to guide the fuzzer. In contrast
to the two aforementioned techniques, this approach allows a
more systematic exploration of the program’s behavior based on
the data representing the internal state of the program. As a
consequence, using only a small (usually one line) annotation, a
user can help the fuzzer to solve previously unsolvable challenges.
We extended various AFL-based fuzzers with the ability to
annotate the source code of the target application with guidance
hints. Our evaluation demonstrates that such simple annotations
are able to solve problems that—to the best of our knowledge—
no other current fuzzer or symbolic execution based tool can
overcome. For example, with our extension, a fuzzer is able
to play and solve games such as Super Mario Bros. or resolve
more complex patterns such as hash map lookups. To further
demonstrate the capabilities of our annotations, we use AFL
combined with IJON to uncover both novel security issues and
issues that previously required a custom and comprehensive
grammar to be uncovered. Lastly, we show that using IJON and
AFL, one can solve many challenges from the CGC data set that
resisted all fully automated and human guided attempts so far.</p>

<p>Applying modern fuzzers to novel targets is often a very lucrative venture. Hypervisors are part of a very critical code
base: compromising them could allow an attacker to compromise the whole cloud infrastructure of any cloud provider. In
this paper, we build a novel fuzzer that aims explicitly at testing modern hypervisors.</p>
<p>Our high throughput fuzzer design for long running interactive targets allows us to fuzz a large number of hypervisors,
both open source, and proprietary. In contrast to one-dimensional fuzzers such as AFL, HYPER-CUBE can interact with any
number of interfaces in any order.</p>
<p>Our evaluation shows that we can find more bugs (over 2x) and coverage (as much as 2x) than state of the art hypervisor
fuzzers. Additionally, in most cases, we were able to do so using multiple orders of magnitude less time than comparable
fuzzers. HYPER-CUBE was also able to rediscover a set of well-known vulnerabilities for hypervisors, such as VENOM, in
less than five minutes. In total, HYPER-CUBE found 54 novel bugs, and so far we obtained 37 CVEs.</p>
<p>Our evaluation results demonstrates that next generation coverage-guided fuzzers should incorporate a higher-throughput
design for long running targets such as hypervisors.</p>

<p>A hypervisor (also know as virtual machine monitor, VMM) enforces the security boundaries between different virtual
machines (VMs) running on the same physical machine. A malicious user who is able to run her own kernel on a cloud VM
can interact with a large variety of attack surfaces. Exploiting a software fault in any of these surfaces leads to full
access to all other VMs that are co-located on the same host. Hence, the efficient detection of hypervisor
vulnerabilities is crucial for the security of the modern cloud infrastructure. Recent work showed that blind fuzzing is
the most efficient approach to identify security issues in hypervisors, mainly due to an outstandingly high test
throughput.</p>
<p>In this paper we present the design and implementation of NYX, a highly optimized, coverage-guided hypervisor fuzzer. We
show how a fast snapshot restoration mechanism that allows us to reload the system under test thousands of times per
second is key to performance. Furthermore, we introduce a novel mutation engine based on custom bytecode programs,
encoded as directed acyclic graphs (DAG), and affine types, that enables the required flexibility to express complex
interactions. Our evaluation shows that, while NYX has a lower throughput than the state-of-the-art hypervisor fuzzer,
it performs competitively on simple targets: NYX typically requires only a few minutes longer to achieve the same test
coverage. On complex devices, however, our approach is able to significantly outperform existing works. Moreover, we are
able to uncover substantially more bugs: in total, we uncovered 44 new bugs with 22 CVEs requested. Our results
demonstrate that coverage guidance is highly valuable, even if a blind fuzzer can be significantly faster.</p>

<p>Coverage-guided fuzz testing (&ldquo;fuzzing&rdquo;) has become mainstream and we have observed lots of progress in this research
area recently. However, it is still challenging to efficiently test network services with existing coverage-guided
fuzzing methods. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of Nyx-Net, a novel snapshot-based fuzzing
approach that can successfully fuzz a wide range of targets spanning servers, clients, games, and even Firefox&rsquo;s
Inter-Process Communication (IPC) interface. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, Nyx-Net improves test throughput by
up to 300x and coverage found by up to 70%. Additionally, Nyx-Net is able to find crashes in two of ProFuzzBench&rsquo;s
targets that no other fuzzer found previously. When using Nyx-Net to play the game Super Mario, Nyx-Net shows speedups
of 10-30x compared to existing work. Under some circumstances, Nyx-Net is even able play &ldquo;faster than light&rdquo;: solving
the level takes less wall-clock time than playing the level perfectly even once. Nyx-Net is able to find previously
unknown bugs in servers such as Lighttpd, clients such as MySQL client, and even Firefox&rsquo;s IPC mechanism - demonstrating
the strength and versatility of the proposed approach. Lastly, our prototype implementation was awarded a $20.000 bug
bounty for enabling fuzzing on previously unfuzzable code in Firefox and solving a long-standing problem at Mozilla.</p>
